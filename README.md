AR building blocks.

## EDM

EDM (Electric Distance Measurement) in the survey terminology is useful for AR applications as well.

Last year I saw this AR deivce "[SiteVision](https://sitevision.trimble.com)" at a trade show in Tokyo. The device is also equipped with Lazer-based EDM.

iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro are equipped with LiDAR. I have found that EDM based on the LiDAR is very useful when I am placing an AR anchor on a wall.
