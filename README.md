# AR building blocks

(Work in progress)

I have been working on AR apps over the past half year in my spare time. This project is for sorting out AR building blocks I have developed in those AR apps.

## EDM

EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) in the surveying terminology is useful for AR applications as well.

Last year I saw this AR device "[SiteVision](https://sitevision.trimble.com)" at a trade show in Tokyo. The device is also equipped with Lazer-based EDM.

iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro are equipped with LiDAR. I have found that EDM based on the LiDAR is very useful when I am placing an AR anchor on a wall. I have been devising a mini-version of SiteVision for indoor AR applications these days.

## Indoor navigation

This is an indoor navigation app using AR for positioning its user in a building.
